\isection{About BornAgain}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

BornAgain is a software package
to simulate and fit
reflectometry, off-specular scattering,
and grazing-incidence small-angle scattering (GISAS)
of X-rays and neutrons.
It provides a generic framework
for modeling multilayer samples with smooth or
rough interfaces and with various types of embedded nanoparticles.
The name, \BornAgain,
alludes to the central role of the distorted-wave Born
approximation (DWBA) in the physical description of the
scattering process.
